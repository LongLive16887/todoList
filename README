My first fun project in framework knockout.js 
this is was my project for defend my presentation university TUIT. 
I won mine teacher :) and he put me 5/5 

knockout.js good framework for mini projects, 
if you have more free time, you can use it for fun.

I used "localStorage" for save data.
